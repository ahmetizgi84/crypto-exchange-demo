                selling our users' personal information to others. Woynex shares users' personal information only as
                described below and with the subsidiaries or affiliates of Woynex that are either subject to this
                Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Notice.

                Third party service providers: We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our
                behalf. Examples include analysing data, providing marketing assistance, processing payments,
                transmitting content, and assessing and managing credit risk. These third-party service providers have
                access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.
                Further, they must process the personal information in accordance with this Privacy Notice and as only

                remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the user
                consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that Woynex or substantially all of its assets are
                acquired, user information will be one of the transferred assets.

                Protection of Woynex and others: We release account and other personal information when we believe
                release is appropriate to comply with the law or with our regulatory obligations; enforce or apply our
                Terms of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property or safety of Woynex, our users or

                protection rules, except where the country to which the data is transferred has already been determined
                by the European Commission to provide an adequate level of protection.
